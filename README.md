#### <p align="justify">Medical imaging is assisting well to control diabetic retinopathy disease to some certain level. However, researchers are still trying to find some optimal approach which can be highly accurate. Mainly, segmentation of blood vessels is an  essential step of diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. Retinal ophthalmologists require efficient segmentation tools/applications  to segment the blood vessels in the eye fundus images due to its sensitivity to vascular disorders; to analyze the several retinal based disorders.</p> 
#### <p align="justify">So here is an implementation of a tool that is capable to segment the blood vessels in eye fundus images. The proposed methodology is tested on the DRIVE dataset and the segmented images are compared with the manual segmented images.</p>
